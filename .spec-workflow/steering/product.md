# Product Overview

## Product Purpose
Claude Code Viewer is a comprehensive web-based client for Claude Code that transforms local conversation files into an interactive, real-time development environment. It solves the problem of limited visibility and control over Claude Code sessions by providing a full-featured web interface for managing conversations, monitoring tasks, and browsing project history.

- Team collaboration through shared access to conversation logs
- Improved workflow management for complex development tasks

Key pain points addressed:
- Difficulty tracking conversation history across multiple projects
- Limited visibility into running Claude tasks and their progress
- Need for better conversation organization and filtering
- Lack of real-time synchronization between local files and UI
- Challenge of resuming paused conversations with proper context
