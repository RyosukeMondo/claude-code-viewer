# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Task Feature provides automated task execution capabilities for Claude Code projects that integrate with the spec-workflow system. This feature enables users to define predefined prompts and completion conditions, then automatically execute Claude Code sessions to work through remaining tasks in a spec. The system monitors task progress and continues execution until all tasks are completed or the user cancels the operation.

This feature addresses the need for automated, systematic task execution while maintaining visibility and control over the development process.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports several key aspects outlined in product.md:

- **Interactive Claude Code Client**: Extends the web interface with automated task execution capabilities
- **Real-time Task Management**: Provides automated monitoring and control of Claude tasks with live status indicators  
- **Enhanced Developer Productivity**: Reduces manual overhead by automating repetitive task initiation and monitoring
- **Workflow Management**: Improves management of complex development tasks through systematic execution
- **Developer-Centric UX**: Maintains transparency and control while automating routine operations

The Task Feature aligns with the product principle of **Reliability** by providing robust error handling and **Transparency** by maintaining full visibility into task status and system state.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to start automated task execution with predefined prompts, so that I can systematically work through remaining spec tasks without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user clicks "Start New Task" button THEN system SHALL display a modal similar to "Start New Chat" 
2. WHEN modal opens THEN system SHALL provide an area to input predefined prompt text
3. WHEN modal opens THEN system SHALL provide selection for completion condition (initially spec-workflow task completion only)
4. WHEN user provides prompt and selects completion condition THEN system SHALL validate inputs before allowing task start
5. WHEN user confirms task creation THEN system SHALL start new Claude Code chat with the specified prompt

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically monitor task progress, so that I can track completion status without manual checking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Claude Code session starts THEN system SHALL monitor chat history for mcp__spec-workflow__manage-tasks tool usage
2. WHEN mcp__spec-workflow__manage-tasks tool is used THEN system SHALL capture and parse the tool result data
3. WHEN tool result contains task summary THEN system SHALL extract total and completed counts from data.summary
4. WHEN task progress changes THEN system SHALL update UI with current completion status
5. WHEN Claude Code session stops THEN system SHALL automatically check final task status

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic task continuation, so that all remaining tasks are completed without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Claude Code session completes THEN system SHALL check if data.summary.total equals data.summary.completed
2. IF all tasks are completed (total === completed) THEN system SHALL stop task execution automatically
3. IF tasks remain incomplete (total > completed) THEN system SHALL start new Claude Code session with same predefined prompt
4. WHEN starting continuation session THEN system SHALL use identical prompt and completion conditions
5. WHEN user clicks "Cancel Task" THEN system SHALL stop automatic continuation and cancel any pending task execution

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear visibility into automated task execution, so that I understand system status and can intervene if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN automated task is running THEN system SHALL display current task execution status
2. WHEN task monitoring is active THEN system SHALL show progress indicators with completed/total task counts
3. WHEN new Claude Code session starts automatically THEN system SHALL provide notification of continuation
4. WHEN task execution encounters errors THEN system SHALL display error information and pause automation
5. WHEN all tasks complete THEN system SHALL provide clear completion notification with final status

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error handling when spec-workflow data structure changes, so that I can understand and adapt to system changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system parses mcp__spec-workflow__manage-tasks tool result THEN system SHALL validate expected data structure
2. IF data.summary object is missing THEN system SHALL display error: "Spec-workflow data structure missing 'summary'. Check spec-workflow system for changes."
3. IF data.summary.total or data.summary.completed properties are missing THEN system SHALL display error: "Spec-workflow summary structure changed. Expected 'total' and 'completed' properties. Check spec-workflow specification for updates."
4. IF data structure validation fails THEN system SHALL pause task automation and display specific error message indicating which properties are missing or changed
5. WHEN data structure error occurs THEN system SHALL provide guidance to "Check spec-workflow specification for structural changes" and stop automatic task continuation

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Separate components for task modal, task monitoring service, and execution controller
- **Modular Design**: Task execution logic isolated from UI components and chat management
- **Dependency Management**: Task feature should integrate cleanly with existing Claude Code integration without tight coupling
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined contracts between task management, monitoring, and UI components

### Performance
- Task monitoring should have minimal impact on chat performance
- Progress checking should not block user interface responsiveness
- Automated session creation should complete within 5 seconds of trigger

### Security
- Predefined prompts must be validated and sanitized before execution
- Task execution should respect existing Claude Code security boundaries
- No automatic execution of potentially harmful commands without user awareness

### Reliability
- Task monitoring must handle Claude Code session failures gracefully
- System should recover from interrupted task execution by resuming from last known state
- Clear error reporting when task monitoring or automation fails
- Robust validation of spec-workflow data structure with clear error messages when structure changes

### Usability
- Task creation modal should follow existing design patterns from "Start New Chat"
- Progress indicators should be clearly visible and informative
- Users should be able to easily cancel automated execution at any time
- Error messages should provide clear guidance for resolving spec-workflow compatibility issues
